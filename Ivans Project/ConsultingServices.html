	<p class="text2">Hyper-automation “deals with the application of advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), to increasingly automate processes and augment humans. Hyper-automation extends across a range of tools that can be automated, but also refers to the sophistication of the automation (i.e., discover, analyse, design, automate, measure, monitor, reassess.)” 

	In simple terms, hyper-automation refers to the mixture of automation technologies that exist to augment and expand human capabilities. 

	How is Hyper-automation Different from Regular Automation?

	When we think of automation, terms like robotic process automation come to mind. But, hyper-automation takes an ecosystem of technologically advanced tools and combines them to create a new way to work. 

	It means that low-value tasks are optimally performed with automation tools, machine learning and advanced artificial intelligence so that outputs can be produced automatically and run efficiently with little to no human intervention. Then, together with humans, hyper-automation can create a workplace that is always informed, agile and able to use data and insights for quick and accurate decision-making.

	<h2 align="center" class="text1">Multi-Experience</h2>
	<img src="Multiexperience.png" alt="app development" align="left" height="400" width="400">
	<p class="text2">Multiexperience is a concept pioneered by Gartner late in 2019. The concept is being championed as one of the biggest developments for 2020. In fact, Gartner states that “more than 25% of the mobile apps, progressive web apps and conversational apps at large enterprises will be built and/or run through a multiexperience development platform” by 2023.

	In short, multiexperience is about adapting to the increasing market of different devices and their respective experiences. Applications now need to run on different platforms and adapt easily, all while providing a consistent experience from a business perspective.

	Why is this relevant? For one, it’s because a few companies are already doing it and, for another, it’s because the average individual currently owns 3.2 different devices. In other words, it’s becoming the increasingly expected norm.

	<p class="text2">Industry experts believe that together, edge computing and distributed cloud improve the user experience of a network. While these technologies are related, they are distinct and unique.

	Edge computing refers to computing happening at the edge of a network. Various access points define the network edge, hence the name for its architectural standard, Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC). Edge access points include cell phone towers, routers, WiFi, and local data centers.

	A distributed cloud refers to having computation, storage, and networking in a micro-cloud located outside the centralized cloud. Examples of a distributed cloud include both fog computing and edge computing. Establishing a distributed cloud situates computing closer to the end user, providing decreased latency and opportunities for increased security. Potential security solutions include a blockchain-based security architecture or random auditing of data to check for integrity. A distributed cloud also processes data in real-time.
